# SoChack
## Introduction

This project is about reading out the current state of charge (percentage value) of the Hyundai IONIQ electric and making it available on a small website.

## Motivation

Unfortunately, the Hyundai does not provide a possibility in Europe . This rather unpleasant condition I took as an opportunity to start this small project. More beautiful, of course, would be a ready-made solution from the manufacturer. Since this is not given, there is now this tinkering, but so far in my IONIQ its purpose fulfilled and always informed me about the battery level.

## Installation

## Architecture

This project is splitted into a client script (python) which runs on an raspberry pi and server side PHP script which provides the website
